Welcome to my BI Analytics portfolio. Below are projects I've worked on at TripleTen that demonstrate my skills in data analysis/cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.

Project #1: NYC Airbnb Property Investment:
- The project task was to figure out which neighborhoods and property sizes in Manhattan are most attractive for vacation rentals as well as how much money they generated as a result.
- Software used: Google Sheets

Project #2: Ecommerce User Activity Analysis:
- I analyzed user behavior through an ecommerce website based on event logs. The goal of the project was to evaluate website performance, user retention, and conversion rates across a customer's journey through the website. 
- Software used: Google Sheets

Project #3: Startup Trends Analysis:
-  I explored funding, acquisition, and founder data using SQL inside a simulated database provided by TripleTen. The project focused on real-world business scenarios, including analyzing startup failure rates, investment volatility, and education impact on success.
-  Software used: SQL (TripleTen browser-based platform)

Project #4: SuperStore Operations Analysis:
- I analyzed SuperStore's operations and the goal was to increase profitability to avoid bankruptcy. I looked at 3 different areas: profit & losses, advertising (determine if worth it), and returned items by customers. 
- Software used: Tableau

Project #5: SuperStore Return Analysis:
- I created a Tableau story dashboard to analyze customer return rates across product sub-categories, regions, and shipping methods. The goal was to identify patterns and recommend ways to reduce losses caused by frequent returns.
- Software used: Tableau
