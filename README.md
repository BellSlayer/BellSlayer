Welcome to my BI Analytics portfolio. Below are projects I've worked on at TripleTen that demonstrate my skills in data analysis/cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.

| Project number | Title | Software used | Description | 
| :-----------: | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1 | [NYC Airbnb Property Investment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQdpDcBoRx42XJQpwrSzOWQVx6KOuW0xXI2gdKOKoJ0/edit?usp=sharing) | Google Sheets | The project task was to figure out which neighborhoods and property sizes in Manhattan are most attractive for vacation rentals as well as how much money they generated as a result. |
| 2 | [Ecommerce User Activity Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oMQMKM8wiZqpQBTttwxDWZSm3Ft1FpPK4tXQvPy3obM/edit?usp=sharing) | Google Sheets | I analyzed user behavior through an ecommerce website based on event logs. The goal of the project was to evaluate website performance, user retention, and conversion rates across a customer's journey through the website. |
| 3 | [Startup Trends Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bLrwpmLOZ0PXq1ZaSYJS-jb_pW3F1mE/view?usp=sharing) | SQL (TripleTen browser-based platform) |  I explored funding, acquisition, and founder data using SQL inside a simulated database provided by TripleTen. The project focused on real-world business scenarios, including analyzing startup failure rates, investment volatility, and education impact on success. |
| 4 | [SuperStore Operations Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/Sprint4Project-2025-07-17/3C-AvgProfitvs_ReturnRatebySub-Category?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) | Tableau | I analyzed SuperStore's operations and the goal was to increase profitability to avoid bankruptcy. I looked at 3 different areas: profit & losses, advertising (determine if worth it), and returned items by customers. |
| 5 | [SuperStore Return Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperStoreReturnAnalysis-EthanBell/ReturnRatebySub-CategoryRegion?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) & [Demo](https://youtu.be/GVW2nAM33FE)| Tableau | I created a Tableau story dashboard to analyze customer return rates across product sub-categories, regions, and shipping methods. The goal was to identify patterns and recommend ways to reduce losses caused by frequent returns. |
